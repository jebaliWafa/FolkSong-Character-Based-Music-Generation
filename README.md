# FolkSong-Character-Based-Music-Generation

This project generates music sequences from a dataset of **folk songs** using **character-level RNN, LSTM, and GRU models**. The generated sequences are exported as **MIDI files** for playback and analysis.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Train **RNN, LSTM, and GRU models** on a folk song dataset.
- Generate new music sequences using **Top-K sampling**.
- Export generated sequences to **MIDI files** (`generated_music_rnn.mid`, `generated_music_lstm.mid`, `generated_music_gru.mid`).
- Compare outputs of different models to evaluate style and sequence quality.
